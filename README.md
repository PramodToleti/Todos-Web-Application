# TodosApp
Developed persistent todo application with CRUD operations to track a list of tasks

● Displayed list of todos with HTML list elements, styled todo list using CSS, Bootstrap
● Implemented todo crud operations by using JavaScript event listeners and updated UI dynamically by using "JavaScript DOM operations".
● Used Arrays, Objects, and their methods during todo list CRUD Operations, Persisted todo list state on page reloads using "local storage" methods. 

Note: I linked the web pages using DOM manipulations. You have to enter your name every time the page refreshes and as the task items are stored in local storage, all users can access and modify the data.
